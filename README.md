# VirtFogSim
VirtFogSim is a MATLAB-supported software toolbox that allows the dynamic joint optimization and tracking of the energy and delay performance of Mobile-Fog-Cloud systems for the execution of applications described by general Directed Application Graphs (DAGs).

In a nutshell, main peculiar features of the proposed VirtFogSim toolbox are that: (i) it allows the joint dynamic energy-aware optimization of the placement of the application tasks and the allocation of the needed computing-networking resources under hard constraints on the allowed overall execution times; (ii) it allows the repeatable and customizable simulation of the resulting energy-delay performance of the overall system; (iii) it allows the dynamic tracking of the performed resource allocation under time-varying operational environments, as those typically featuring mobile applications; (iv) it is equipped by an user-friendly Graphic User Interface (GUI) that supports a number of graphic formats for data rendering; and, (v) its MATLAB code is optimized for running atop multi-core parallel execution platforms.

VirtFogSim is based on the following papers:
1. M. Scarpiniti, E. Baccarelli and A. Momenzadeh, "VirtFogSim: A Parallel Toolbox for Dynamic Energy-Delay Performance Testing and Optimization of 5G Mobile-Fog-Cloud Virtualized Platforms", *Applied Sciences*, Vol. 9, N. 6, Paper 1160, pp. 1-48, March 2019.
